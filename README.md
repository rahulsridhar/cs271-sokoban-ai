CS271 Final Project
===================

This project implements different search algorithms for finding solutions to
Sokoban problems.

So far, the game engine has been implemented.

The test files give examples of how the different objects are used.

Type `make state_test` to build the *state_test.cpp* example, and then
`bin/state_test` to run it.

Type `make problem_test` to build the *problem_test.cpp* example, and then
`bin/problem_test` to run it.
