CS271 Final Project
===================

This project implements different search algorithms for finding solutions to
Sokoban problems.

So far, the game engine, IDA-star search and heuristic-computing methods have been implemented.

The test files give examples of how the different objects are used.

Type `make state_test` to build the *state_test.cpp* example, and then
`bin/state_test` to run it.

Type `make problem_test` to build the *problem_test.cpp* example, and then
`bin/problem_test` to run it.

Type `make ida_star_test` to build the *ida_star_test.cpp* example, and then
`bin/ida_star_test` to run it.

Type `make heuristic_test` to build the *heuristic_test.cpp* example, and then
`bin/heuristic_test` to run it.

Type `make bbsolver_test` to build the *bbsolver_test.cpp* example, and then
`bin/heuristic_test` to run it.
